The data collected from the IMU sensor data while driving a small mobile robot over different floor surfaces. 
The task is to predict which one of the nine floor types (carpet, tiles, concrete) the robot is on using sensor data such as acceleration and velocity. 
It will help in the navigation of robots without assistance across many different surfaces, so they wonâ€™t fall down on the job.
